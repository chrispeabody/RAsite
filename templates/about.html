                <p class="text-faded">Abstract: Applications have their own security risks before they're deployed in a cloud environment. To be able to obtain all the benefits that come along with utilizing the cloud environment, a client should know the different variety of security risks that will arise from deploying their application on the cloud. Security risks increase for applications deployed on the cloud because the client has no input in how the cloud platform plans to mitigate and prevent attacks. Leading to all cloud providers having different security plans in place for their own services. We propose a risk assessment model based on Bayesian Probability that will produce a trust score that is dependent on four attributes, coming in the form of qualitative and quantitative data; cost, quality of service and experience, and security of a Cloud Service Provider(CSP). These attributes are then combined using Bayes' Theorem and are important for the client to know when trying to decide between different CSPs, allowing for a customizable score for each CSP. Our method has been implemented on a web application where users can input certain preferences and conduct calculations on five CSPs.</p>
