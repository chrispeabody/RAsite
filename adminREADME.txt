To aggregate all the reviews for the subjective part of the algorithm, you must visit the usl /aggReviews/ while the site is open. Wait until the text in the console says it is complete before you continue. You can then run this at any time to update the review database.

In order to initialize default value tables, visit the /initTables/ url while the site is open. Run this only after reviews have been aggregated at least once.

Once both of these functionalities have run at least once, the application may be used freely.
